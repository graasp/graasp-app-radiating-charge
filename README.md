# Oscillating Charge: A Physics Simulation

A stationary charged particle emits a radial electric field. When caused to oscillate, the charge's electric field also moves, with a wavelength determined by the speed of light and frequency of oscillation.

This application simulates the behavior of a charged particle's electric field. Initially stationary, the charge can be made to oscillate (with a sinusoidal motion). The frequency of oscillation can be adjusted to generate a range of wavelengths covering the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra. The simulation can be paused, allowing users to measure and examine the wavelengths generated by a chosen frequency.

## Try the application!

A live deployment of the application can be accessed [here](https://apps.graasp.eu/5acb589d0d5d9464081c2d46/5fc795f6f254ade34781a368/latest/index.html). Please submit any issues you identify to the application's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/graasp/graasp-app-radiating-charge).

## Run and modify the application locally

- Once you clone the repository, run `yarn` or `npm install` to install its dependencies.
- In the project directory, make sure to create an `.env.local` file and to add `"REACT_APP_BASE="` to the top of this file. You can do this through your shell by running `touch .env.local` and `echo "REACT_APP_BASE=" >> .env.local` in the project root.
- Run `yarn start` (or `npm start`) to start the application. It should automatically open in your browser at `localhost:3000`. You can also access it in development mode on `http://localhost:3000/?appInstanceId=6156e70ab253020033364411&spaceId=5b56e70ab253020033364411&dev=true`
- The simulation's main components are located in `src/components/lab` (canvas components) and `src/components/common` (side menu and controls). It uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux), and [React-Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva).
